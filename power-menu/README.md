# Power Menu

This source code was taken from [androeaTT/power-menu](https://github.com/androeaTT/power-menu).

A simple power menu with options for power off, reboot, and logout. Built using [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags/).

For working blur, add this to your `hyprland.conf`:

```ini
layerrule = blur, gtk4-layer-shell
layerrule = ignorezero, gtk4-layer-shell
```
