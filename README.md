# Linux Desktop

Configuration files, applications, and setup for my Linux desktop. Tailored for my Lenovo Thinkpad T430.

![desktop screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Installation

Execute scripts:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

```sh
./install.sh
```

```sh
./configs.sh
```

```sh
./post-setup.sh
```

Reboot the machine, then run:

```sh
./post-reboot.sh
```

## First Time Setup

Run `nwg-displays` (should appear as "Display Settings" in Fuzzel) and configure your display settings. Applying the display settings through `nwg-displays` will generate `~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf` with your display settings.

## Packages

For a full list of installed packages, see `packages.arch.txt`, `packages.aur.txt`, and `packages.flatpak.txt`.

## System Updater

Always use the "System Update" application in Fuzzel to update the system. This is a custom script that updates all Arch packages, AUR packages, and Flatpaks. Using this script ensures that `yay` does not break due to missed system updates. Additionally, this script downloads and installs the latest version of Google Widevine whenever Ungoogled Chromium is updated.

## Screenshot Utility

Use `Super + S` to take a screenshot.

## Troubleshooting

**Bluetooth Not Working**

If no devices are showing up in Blueman, check if `bluetooth.service` is enabled and running.

```sh
sudo systemctl status bluetooth.service
```

Enable and start it with:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
```
